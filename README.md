## Overall Concept of Application:

To help users decide on what they feel like doing for dinner. Whether you feel like making dinner at home, we provide a recipe to chose from or if you want to go out and spoil yourself, we can help with that decision.

## Motivation:

With our busy lifestyles and trying to cram as much into our lives as possible, sometimes we have run out of ideas on what to do for dinner - this where we wanted to help the end user, providing a resource to help decide.

## Design Process:

- Deciding whether you want a recipe or restaurant.
- 4 Options of the preferred choice
- When the user decides on the desired choice, 3 new choices will show up keeping the first choice there.
- Whatever the user decides as their final decision will show up after it has been clicked, this will either show the recipe steps or restaurant choices.
- The user can decide whether they want to start over or go with their preferred choice.
